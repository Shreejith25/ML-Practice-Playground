## Decision Tree Classifier with Pre-Pruning & Post-Pruning

This project showcases a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset , implementing Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning techniques to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. The classifier is built in Python, leveraging scikit-learn for model building, tuning, and evaluation.

### ðŸ“š Overview
The Iris dataset is used to train and evaluate the model, which is split into training and testing sets in a 70-30 split (random state = 42). The objective is to classify flowers into three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on features like ðŸŒ± sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Training the Model
#### Post-Pruning
Post-pruning involves growing the tree fully and then trimming it back to control complexity.

####  Pre-Pruning
Pre-pruning restricts the tree's growth during training by limiting parameters like max_depth and criterion.

Post-Pruning: Allows the tree to grow entirely before reducing complexity, often yielding high accuracy.
Pre-Pruning: Controls tree growth from the start, reducing overfitting risks early.
